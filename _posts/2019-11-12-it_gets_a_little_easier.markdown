After completing my second portfolio project i can say with confidence that coding is becoming a bit easier to understand. When doing my first project some of the most simple code such as pushing objects into arrays was confusing for me. Even OOR was still a little confusing for me after i had passed the first section. However when i was going throught the second section we had to use what we learned from previous lessions in our code. I can say it's a bit easier after you code for sometime but you can say that about everything in life.

like everyone who is good at something they first must suck at it. It is true with everything and is especially true in coding. when i fisrt started this jorney to learn how to code i had no idea what i was doing. Now after doing it for about two and a half months it's a little easier to understand and work with. So dont give up just because its hard in the beginning just keep working at it even if your struggling ask for some help maybe someone might have a better way of explaining it so that you understand how this kind of code works.
