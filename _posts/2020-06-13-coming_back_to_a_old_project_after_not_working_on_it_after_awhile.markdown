When you come back to a project after not working on it the first thig you are going to want to do is look over the code.
The reason for this is simple, it's to refamiliarize your self with the code that you written. You need to go back and understand what every class and function does and why it needs to be there before you move on to writting new code.

The second thing you need to do is to run your code and see what works and what is broken. you need to see if any of your functions need to be fixed for future use. You never know when some of the stuff that you had written previously will be needed in the new code that you will be writting.
