There is a lot i can say about my first ever CLI project, and a lot i can complain about.
However i cant say that i didn't learn anything which is what i came here to do.
it was great being able to use the knowledge that i have acquired over time with this course. Such as class methods and instance methods, the difference between objects and classes, and explicit and implicit return.

	For this project my ice cream app shows the user 35 flavors that they can choose from. Once they have choose a number it will give them a brief description as well as the what size it come in. I choose ice cream as a topic for this project because I started this project at the end of summer which is typicality the hottest part of the year.

	The class and instance methods that I have in my code where a great refresher for me. Instance methods are methods that can called with an instance of an object. While class methods can be called by the object its self. 

	In conclusion this project was a great way for me to review and use everything I learned in this section of the course.
