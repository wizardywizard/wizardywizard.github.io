There is a lot i can say about my first ever CLI project, and a lot i can complain about.
However i cant say that i didnt learn anything which is what i came here to do.
it was great being able to use the knowledge that i have acquired over time with this course.
there is also more to be desired when you start this project as well.

The nice thing about this project is that you use material from previous lessons. 
From scraping websites to makeing objects using OOR and making your own CLI.
I'm glad to see that all of the lessons i will be able to take with me into the working world.

This project didn't come without its fair share of problems thought that are not covered.
For starters they ask you to not use IDE that was provied for you from the start of the course.
As a newbie to the world of code this caused a lot of confusion becase i was not sure how to go about 
what to use to create my code. Then installing it was a bit difficult becase there are so many precise downloads that you need in order to make sure your enviroment runs properly. The fact that they drop on you when you have to do your portfolio project is just poor planning. I can go on about the faults of this project but those are some of the key issus for a beginner like me.
