When i was working on my rails project naturally i encountered many errors. One thing my cohoart leader told me when i first stared this project was to not just focus on what the error was showing me. You need to look at the flow of the code not just the error. If you are getting an error somewhere in your views it could be a problem in your controller. It can even be down all the way to the schema.

The point that i'm trying to drive home for you is dont just look at the what the error is showing you. Look at everything from your models to your views look over eveything. Just because everything is right on one part of your code doesn't mean everything is it could be something small like missing a letter in part of your code that throws everything off.
